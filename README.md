# compose-dbeaver

Docker Compose for Docker Hub dbeaver image

TODO: initialize DBeaver admin

May need to set allowPublicKeyRetrieval to TRUE in the mysql connection options.
May also need to set useSSL to FALSE, but probably not required.
These are not secure network configurations, but ok for docker in dev mode.
